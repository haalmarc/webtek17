        <h2>1. Administrative Details</h2>
        <p> Client name: Trondheim Lindy Hop </p>
        <p>Website name: Trondheim Lindy Hop </p>
        <p>Contact Person: Maja Nowak</p>
        <h2>2. Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>This website's purpose is, first of all to upgrade Trondheim Lindy Hops existing web page,
            and in doing so making TLH more accessible to the public.
            Our goal is the same as our clients; to invite people into the great world of the Lindy Hop dance.
            The audience we are trying to reach are those who have danced Lindy Hop previously
            and want to start dancing more frequently, and those who are new and curious as to what Lindy Hop is.</p>
        <h2>3. Navigation structure</h2>
        <p>
            The website will consist of 4 webpages, 3 of which will be accessible from all the other pages.
            This way all the information available is accessible from the entire website.
            The last webpage will be a signup form, which will only be reachable from the courses page,
            but will have the same navbar as the other webpages. Here is an organizational map of the website.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this section we will present the design decisions that are common across all webpages of the website.
            In the content section we have more specific information about the individual webpages and associated mockup
            images. We’ve had a focus on readability when choosing our design. Throughout the pages we want to create
            breathing room for the user, using a smaller width and using margins and padding. We have followed a
            standard text size to ensure readability. We’ve chosen contrasting colors to make the text more readable, as
            well as to accommodate the feel we want the page to give. Since Lindy Hop is a dance style from the early
            19th century we have chosen black and white pictures to give the site a vintage look.

            5. Content
        </h2>
        <h3>Homepage</h3>
        <figure>
            <img class="mockup" src="img/home_mockup.png" alt="Homepage Mockup">
        </figure>
        <p>This page will provide an overview about what resources you can find on the page.
            From here you can orient yourself on how to find information about the group and
            the dance lindy hop, scheduled courses, events and also find a translated
            version of the page. The page should give a clear view of what information
            you can find, through having a simple and easily readable page.
            By using Javascript the background image will slowly change in a slideshow.
            By doing this we hope that the page will feel more inspiring, and will make the user want
            to stay on the page longer to view the different pictures of the dance.
        </p>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <figure>
            <img class="mockup" src="img/about_mockup.png" alt="About page mockup">
        </figure>
        <p>
            This section is going to give the user some information about our client.
            This includes a short introduction to what kind of group our client is,
            group history, some information about the services our client provides,
            goals, general information about events and courses, facebook page, physical
            address as well as the names of some of the central figures in our clients hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The page consists of two parts, excluding footer and header: the title “Om oss” and
            the about us text. The title will be above a background image of people dancing.
            Image has 100% width. The about us text will have a white background and be center aligned.
        </p>
        <h3>Courses</h3>
        <figure>
            <img class="mockup" src="img/kurs_mockup.png" alt="Courses page mockup">
        </figure>
        <p>
            This section will include the scheduled beginner and advanced courses for TLH. The page will
            help members find information on where and when to meet up. The section will also include
            information about what to expect from the course, so the potential member can choose what
            suits them best. On the bottom of the page there will be a link to a registration
            page where the user can sign up for a course.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are going to use two headings, sizes 50px, presenting the two possible courses.
            The first heading and description are going to be on the left side of the page, followed by a
            round picture on the right side (300px width). The second heading and description, we will
            put accordingly on the right side, placing a picture on the left side, here again 300 px width.
            On the bottom of the page we will include a sign up button referring the user to “påmeldingsskjema”.
        </p>
        <h3>Sign up</h3>
        <figure>
            <img class="mockup" src="img/paamelding_mockup.png" alt="Signup page Mockup">
        </figure>
        <p>
            The sign up page is where the user can register him/herself for a course or an event. It will contain a form
            with boxes for:
            <ul>
                <li>First name</li>
                <li>Last name</li>
                <li>Email</li>
                <li>If you are a beginner or have danced before</li>
                <li>Phone number</li>
                <li>Where you heard of TLH</li>
            </ul>
            and checkboxes for membership and ToS, as well as a submit button.
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <figure>
                <img class="mockup" src="img/events_mockup.png" alt="Events page mockup">
            </figure>
            <p>By clicking on “Events” the client is going to be referred to the facebook event page of Trondheim Lindy
                Hop.
                The events page will contain information about courses and events. The facebook calendar is frequently
                updated,
                providing the user with up to date information.</p>
            <h2>6. Minimum Requirements</h2>
            <p>The background of the homepage will consist of a slideshow programmed in JavaScript.
                Since we want to inspire people to dance we want to choose appealing pictures of people dancing.
                The slideshow will make the page more varied, but in order to not overwhelm the user the slideshow
                will have to transition slowly. The JavaScript will be in the file slideshow.js.</p>
            <p>The footer and header on all the pages are going to look the same. We will use JS to implement
                these sections into each html file. This will be written in the header.js and footer.js files
                respectively.</p>
            <p>On the sign up page there will be a submit button. When clicked, a box will pop up and tell the user
                if the submission was successful or not. This will be written in script.js</p>
            <p>Because some of our audience speak english, we are going to give the user an option to translate the
                page.
                This will be done through Google Translate and JS. This will be written in the script.js file.</p>
            <p>If we have time we also hope to add a facebook calendar on a separate "Events" page. This will change a
                lot
                of the structure of the website, but make the website more userfriendly by not having to navigate the
                user off the website.
            </p>
            <h2>7. Plan</h2>
            <p>
                The files will be stored according to the following organizational scheme,
                and the workload will be divided according to the following table.
                The table also contains information about the deadline for completing each file.
            </p>

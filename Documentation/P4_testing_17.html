    <h2><i>Trondheim Lindy Hop</i></h2>
    <p>Vår klient er Trondheim Lindy Hop, som er en organisasjon for folk som er interessert i swingdansen “Lindy Hop”.
      Kontaktpersonen vår er instruktøren Maja Nowak, som også er et medlem av prosjektgruppa vår.</p>
    <h2>Testingen</h2>
    <h3>Testdokumentet</h3>
    <p>A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test the website</p>
    <h3>Testgruppen</h3>
    <p>A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as well</p>
    <h3>Testplattformen</h3>
    <p>A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that your testers used</p>
    <h3>Oppsummering av tilbakemeldinger</h3>
    <p>A summary of the feedback you received organized by question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.</p>
    <h3>Respons til tilbakemeldinger</h3>
    <p>Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.</p>
    <h2>Selvrefleksjon</h2>
    <h3>Felles</h3>
    <p>Since Trondheim has a lot of international students it is important
      that the website is accessible in English. Depending on what is better suited
      for the client, this will either be done with an English version of the website,
      a separate page with a summary of the most important information in English, or a
      link to an automated translation through Google Translate.</p>
